Ubuntu WLAN Hotspot Package
by Keysie, 2016
===========================

General info:
*************

This package contains a set of scripts that facilitate the process
of setting up your ubuntu laptop as a wlan router. I will maintain
it so it keeps working with the version of ubuntu I'm using. Note
that there is explicitly no support for any other version of linux
or ubuntu. That said, it is very likely that the scripts will work
on other versions of ubuntu or even entirely different distros.
Also, the interfaces used are currently eth0 for wired and wlan0
for wireless. To change this, you will have to review all the scripts.
(This might be changed in the future)

-----------------------------
Current version: 14.04 x86_64
-----------------------------

Usage:
******

Make all *.sh files executable and run WLAN.sh as sudo or root.
Once everything is up and running, the accesspoint's output will
run verbosely in the terminal. To shut down the AP and reset your
previous configuration, press CTRL+C. If you abort the process while
it is starting or stopping, there might be unforseen problems with
settings that won't be propperly set or reset.

Normally you should not have to do anything, as there are timeouts
and failsafes implemented to prevent the script from hanging.

Configuration:
**************

Several things must be configured before use. There are three parts
in this package:

- Wired connection (inet is comming from here)
- Wireless hotspot (inet is going to here)
- Routing (the part that connects the two)


Wired:

To configure the wired connection, edit wired.conf. Do not change
anything on the formatting, the parser might not like it...
In this file, you can choose if your computer's ethernet MAC-address
should be changed while the hotspot is up. To disable this feature,
set change-mac=no.
Also in this file, you can configure your ethernet settings. You can
choose type=fix or type=dhcp. If you choose fix, enter the desired
local ip, netmask, gateway, dns and broadcast addresses. If you choose
dhcp, these settings will be ignored and the scripts will try to get 
a dhcp lease.


Wireless:

For the hotspot there are a lot of things you can configure. Everything
related to the operation of the network, such as which driver to use,
the desired SSID, passphrase and so on, can be found in hotspot.conf.
Provided you use the file as found in the repository, then there is
a mac-address filter in place. All accepted addresses must be put into
hotspot.accept. Devices that are not listed there will not be able to
connect to the hotspot. Also, make sure you change the SSID and the
passphrase before you use those files!

To simplify connecting devices to the accesspoint, a DHCP server is
configured to run concurrently. You can change its settings in
dhcpd.conf. DO NOT change anything except the range there, otherwise
the rest will no longer work! DNS and so on will be automatically 
changed based on the other configuration files or the dhcp lease.


Routing

ONLY CHANGE THINGS HERE IF YOU ABSLOUTELY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

Routing is done by using iptables. A few simple rules allow full
communication through your computer from eth0 to wlan0 and back.
If you want, you can change the rules in routing.sh, to achieve
a firewall or whatever you desire.
